Version 1.1 (1/1/2000)
---
- Added typedef conventions.
- Added enumerations.
- Added hexBinary encoding.
- Added base64 encoding.
- Enable pass by reference operator (&) for output parameter.
- Enable specification of methods in classes.

Version 1.2 (9/9/2001)
---
- Added WSDL generator.

Version 1.2w (9/14/2001)
---
- Win32 port.
- Fixed a socket communication problem in win32 version.
- Added namespace name pattern matching to ease validation.

Version 1.2.1 (10/24/2001)
---
- Added chunked HTTP 1.1 transfer support.
- Improved buffering.
- Fixed a problem with nested vector allocation.

Version 1.2.2 (11/2/2001)
---
- Support for special XML element names with dots, underscores, and center dots (see documentation section 5.3).
- Fixed a decoding problem with dynamic array of pointers to polymorphic objects.
- Fixed an encoding problem with enumerations.
- Added a "safe-mode" flag to disable serialization of multi-referenced objects with `soap_disable_href = 1;`
- You can set this global flag anywere in the code, but at least before serialization is performed. It will disable the use of href attributes when sending multi-reference data. Instead, the data is copied in the payload. When set, this flag will hang the serializer when sending cyclic data structures.

Version 1.2.3 (12/5/2001)
---

- Added bool type encoding/decoding.
- Added dynamic multi-dimensional arrays.
- Added support for primitive polymorphic types.
- Added full support for CDATA content decoding.
- More convenient customization of SOAP Headers and Faults. No separate soapheader.h and soapfault.h files required (and therefore no .cpp files have to be created for these). Instead, the compiler generates customized SOAP Header and SOAP Fault marshalling routines when struct/class `SOAP_ENV__Fault` and/or `SOAP_ENV__Header` are specified in the header file input to the compiler.
- On demand generation of the marshalling routines for the primitive types, which reduces the size of the executables.
- Fixed a WSDL incompatibility problem in the WSDL generator.
- Improved decoding of multi-reference elements (no *`xsi:type`* required anymore in receiving message so gSOAP does not break).
- Improved support for encoding/decoding indirect data (e.g. pointers to pointers to data).
- Improved encoding of data with the same pointers to shared data but with the shared data declared with different XML schema types (formerly encoded as multi-reference data which could cause type incmpatibilities at the receiving side). For example, in the declarations `typedef char *xsd__NCName; xsd__NCName *s="SOAP"; char *t = s;` the pointers s and t point to the same data, but will not be encoded as multi-reference data since the types are different.
- Added flag `soap_enable_null = 1;`
- When set, all NULL pointers will be explicitly encoded. By default, NULL pointers are omitted from the SOAP payload. For example, with this flag set all NULL strings and other NULL pointer data will appear as nil values in the SOAP payload.
- Added flag: `soap_enable_embedding = 1;`
- When set, multi-reference data will be encoded inline which will guarantee the exact preservation of the structure of the data transmitted. However, some SOAP implementations do not support embedding inline multi-reference data although this encoding style is likely to be included in future verions of the SOAP protocol. The flag is useful when creating C++ applications that need to communicate data to eachother and the data structures need to be preserved. Setting this flag may cause a duplication of multi-reference data by the receiver created with the SOAP stub compiler when the data is part of a struct/class or array. The data is not copied by the receiver when the struct/class or arrays use pointers to the data type.
- Added the ability to declare virtual destructors.
- Fixed a compilation error with fixed-size array of pointers.
- Fixed a problem with padding in Base64 (en/de)coding.
- Fixed XML entity decoding (hexadecimal).
- Added encoding of sparse arrays. A sparse array MUST be declared as a (fixed-size of dynamic) array of pointers. NULL pointer values are omitted from the output and *`SOAP-ENC:position`* attributes are used for non-NULL elements.
- Changed `soap_put` and `soap_get` functions to include explicit schema type parameters. This fixed a problem with Web services that need to return typedef-ed XML schema types The new stdsoap.cpp and stdsoap.h files are incompatible with the previous version(s).
- Added the ability to ignore the names of accessors when decoding fields through the use of a leading underscore (`_`) in a field name. For example: `ns__mymethod(xsd__string in, xsd__string &_return);`
- When used to invoke a remote method, the actual element name of the remote return parameter used by the service is insignificant.
- Improved memory management. Added new function: `soap_destroy()` to remove all class instances.
- Improved documentation.
- Added `time_t` type support, but still need to add encoding/decoding routines to the runtime (next version).
- Added `wchar_t` type support, but still need to add encoding/decoding routines to the runtime (next version).

- Replaced C lib functions `memcpy`, `memmove`, `strcpy`, `strcat`, `strncpy`, `strncat`, `sscanf`, `sprintf` by more secure alternatives when available on target platform.  On windows you should add an [Invalid Parameter Routine](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ksazx244.aspx), to ignore and let gsoap safely continue with truncated strings (and deal with soft errors later).
- Updated OpenSSL and GNUTLS integration.

    - scoped enumerations (`enum class`) with underlying types (`enum class : type` is 8, 16, 32, or 64 signed int);
    - serialization of smart pointers `std::shared_ptr` and `std::unique_ptr` (and deprecated `std::auto_ptr` if needed);
    - virtual method `final` and `override` syntax;
    - `nullptr` constant member initializer.
    -  More efficient C++11 STL vector, list, and deque deserialization code based on `emplace_back()`.
- Added new `xsd__date` custom serializer `custom/struct_tm_date.h` to bind `struct tm` to *`xsd:date`*.
- Added new `xsd__time` custom serializer `custom/long_time.h` to bind `ULONG64` to *`xsd:time`* with microsecond precision.
- Added new `xsd__duration` custom serializer `custom/chrono_duration.h` to bind C++11 `std::chrono::nanoseconds` to *`xsd:duration`*.
- Added `xsd__dateTime` custom serializer `custom/chrono_time_point.h` to bind C++11 `std::chrono::time_point` to *`xsd:dateTime`*.
- Added new TLS/SSL flags `SOAP_TLSv1_0`, `SOAP_TLSv1_1`, and `SOAP_TLSv1_2` to limit TLS protocol selections.
- Added new SHA224/SHA384 digest options, ECDSA (requires OpenSSL 0.9.8 or later), and HMACOutputLength truncation (within limits) to WSSE.
- Added Galois counter mode (GCM) authenticated encryption to WSSE with AES128/AES192/AES256, requires OpenSSL 1.0.2 or later.
- Added the concept of "mutable" structs and classes, which allow for incremental compile-time addition of new members to the struct/class, which gives them a tuple-like behavior with the tuple being populated in distinct parts of the soapcpp2 input source. This is similar to the way the `SOAP_ENV__Header` struct was already handled. This is not a standard C/C++ feature.
- Added `$CONTAINER = name` and `$POINTER = name` definitions to `typemap.dat` for specifying the C++ container to use (`std::vector` by default) and C++11 smart pointer to use (no smart pointer by default), see [databindings](www.genivia.com/doc/databinding/html).
- Improved soapcpp2 input source code analysis and C/C++ syntax coverage.
- Improved soapcpp2 output WSDL and XSD with added root-level elements and attributes on demand, see [databindings](www.genivia.com/doc/databinding/html).
- Improved efficiency and case coverage of SOAP encoded messages with id-ref anchors using redesigned pre- and post node graph construction analysis algorithms (`soap_id_enter`, `soap_id_forward`, `soap_id_lookup`, and `soap_update_pointers` have changed).
- Improved cyclic data structure detection and XML rendering with non-SOAP-encoded literal style (and/or the `SOAP_XML_TREE` flag) to prune cycles from trees. `SOAP_XML_TREE` produces XML document "trees" rather than id-ref XML graphs. Graphs are produced with SOAP encoding or with the `SOAP_XML_GRAPH` flag.
- Improved primitive `union` members access in C++ by removing unnecessary pointers.
- Improved checking of signatures in WSSE plugin.
- Updated soapcpp2 `size_t` mapping to transient (non-serializable) type. The wsdl2h tool does not generate `size_t`. If `size_t` is used in your header files for soapcpp2, then use `unsigned long` to replace `size_t`, which replicates the old `size_t` mapping to `unsigned long` (beware, this is not portable).
- Updated *`xsi:nil`* serialization rules for pointer-type struct/class members, by forcing *`xsi:nil="true"`* element output for required **nillable** elements (no longer requiring the `SOAP_XML_NIL` flag).
- Updated wsdl2h Nillable optional element annotations (i.e.g for `nillable=true` and `minOccurs>0`), now requiring inbound elements with *`xsi:nil`* or validation error. NULL pointer-based outbound nillable elements with `minOccurs>0` are now serialized with *`xsi:nil="true"`*, see above.
- Updated dateTime content validation with `SOAP_XML_STRICT`, otherwise accepts ISO8601 variants.
- Fixed `SOAP_UNION_name_type_member` macro constants for C++ namespace `name` (wsdl2h option `-qname` to ensure that the generated macro names are unique.
- Fixed attribute serialization when attribute of type `std::string` has a default value while actual value is set to "" (empty).
- Fixed class inheritance from base class `soap_dom_element` (declared in `dom.h`) which should include the content of the DOM node(s) together with the (de)serialized content of the derived class instance.
- Fixed default/fixed values of element/attribute references to global elements/attributes with global default/fixed values.
- Fixed *`xs:group`* and *`xs:substitutionGroup`* element namespace prefix qualifications of struct and classe members.
- Fixed deserialization of nested *`xs:sequence`* class pointers to NULL (structs are OK) when *`xs:sequence`* is optional and sequence data is not present on the inbound stream.
- Fixed missing `custom/struct_timeval.c` inbound microsecond fraction of *`xsd:dateTime`* values.
- Fixed `typedef` of a custom serializer type.
- Fixed `typedef` pointer type use in `@type` attribute declarations.
- Fixed linking against newer EVP functions in older OpenSSL versions to compile WSSE plugin.
- Fixed WSSE decryption with HTTP-chunked and fragmented messages in transport.

Version 2.8.25 (11/11/2015)
---
- Added `xsd__decimal` custom serializer `custom/float128.h` to bind `<quadmath.h>` quad precision float `__float128` to *`xsd:decimal`*.
- Added group circular reference detection to wsdl2h. Generates code for circular group references that is safe to use, but with loss of occurrence validation constraints, if any are present.
- Updated and improved XML-RPC and JSON implementation with wider `_int`, now 64 bit, while keeping XML-RPC type `_i4` to just 32 bit. Existing project C code that uses the XML-RPC and JSON plugin SHOULD be updated to use `_i4` (`int`) instead of `_int` when `_int` is still used as a 32 bit `int` in their project.
- Fixed strict validation of empty elements unless the element is href/ref-attributed with SOAP encoding (this validation check was temporarily lost in the 2.8.24r release).
- Fixed missing `#include <memory>` for smart pointers.
- Fixed float type minInclusive and maxInclusive fractional bounds validation.
- Fixed compilation issues when C++ namespaces (soapcpp2 option `-q`) are used with custom serializers.
- Fixed wsdl2h option `-p`, which may cause type name clashes with generated C++ `xsd__anyType` wrapper classes for simple types.

Version 2.8.26 (11/30/2015)
---
- Added new **jsoncpp** code generator that takes a JSON sample document and renders it in JSON API code for C or C++. The jsoncpp tool is located in `gsoap/samples/xml-rpc-json` with the XML-RPC and JSON APIs and samples.
- Added new C/C++ XML-RPC and JSON APIs `xml-rpc.c` and `json.c[pp]` to simplify JSON and XML-RPC in C and C++. The old `json_c.h` and `json_c.c` are deprecated and removed in favor of the improved APIs `json.h` and `json.c[pp]`.
- Added `xsd__integer` custom serializer `custom/int128.h` to bind big int `__int128_t` to *`xsd:integer`*.
- Added floating point exclusive range bounds notation to gSOAP header file syntax, with `<` on the side of `:` for an exclusive bound (`min <: max` makes `min` exclusive, `min <:< max` makes both exclusive, and `min :< max` makes `max` exclusive), while keeping `min : max` for inclusive bounds.
- Added C++11 syntax for struct/class member initialization with `{ initval }`, which has an identical effect as declaring members with `= initval` initializers. This works in C and C++.
- Added HTTP2 support to WinInet plugin.
- Expanded [XML-RPC and JSON documentation](https://www.genivia.com/doc/xml-rpc-json/html).
- Expanded [Data Bindings documentation](https://www.genivia.com/doc/databinding/html).
- Improved wsdl2h schema import processing when WSDL and XSD have the same namespace and *`xs:import`* is used instead of *`xs:include`* to populate the schema.
- Improved wsdl2h output for integer enumeration constants, omits trailing underscores for pseudo-numeric enum constants, updated soapcpp2 to accept duplicate enum constants in different enum lists when their values are the same.
- Fixed `soap_del_string` memory issue in `char*` string deletion.
- Fixed soapcpp2 option `-s` by enforcing `SOAP_XML_STRICT` on the body of inbound messages for client and server.
- Fixed a rare issue where elements end up missing in a substitutionGroup when several WSDLs with the same namespace are imported into one WSDL.
- Fixed strict validation rejection of empty element body when empty when permitted.

Version 2.8.27 (12/7/2015)
---
- Added new JSONPath code generation feature to jsoncpp in `gsoap/samples/xml-rpc-json` with new option `-p`. Supports C++ (and C in the next release).
- Improved JSON API functionality and robustness.
- Improved substitutionGroup union member: removed prefix `__` from member name and removed rogue `;`.
- Fixed `WITH_NOIDREF` broken `iht` initialization introduced in 2.8.25/26, which may lead to a crash.

Version 2.8.28 (02/01/2016)
---
- Added new **domcpp** code generator that takes an XML sample document and renders it in XML DOM API code for C or C++. Can also convert XPath to XML DOM API code with option `-p`. The domcpp tool is located in `gsoap/samples/dom` with the XML DOM samples.
- Added many new API functions to a fully redisigned XML DOM API v5 for C and C++ with new DOM API documentation.  The redesigned DOM API v5 is mostly backward compatible to DOM API v4, but with DOM string `data` members changed to `text` members.  Many API functions are added to define a clean interface without having to use the DOM structure data members.  The `soap_dom_next_element()` function now takes a second parameter that is an element pointer to stop deep traversal at (use NULL for old behavior).  See updated [XML DOM and XPath](https://www.genivia.com/doc/dom/html) documentation for details.
- Added C serialization to/from strings with new C `soap` struct members `const char *soap::is` input string to parse from and `const char **soap:os` pointer to string that is set by the engine to point to the output.  Note that C++ code is unchanged and the `soap::is` and `soap::os` are still members pointers to `istream` and `ostream` streams (use `std::stringstream` for input/output from/to strings).
- Added JSON API C function `set_size` to set/change array sizes and JSON API C function `set_struct` to create an empty JSON object.
- Improved jsoncpp command line tool to generate JSONPath C code and improved overall to generate more compact code.
- Improved `SOAP_DEFAULTNS` flag to emit XML default namespace declarations.
- Improved strictness of XML verification under default settings (i.e. without requiring `SOAP_XML_STRICT`).
- Changed string deserialization when XML content with tags is encountered: XML tags are no longer parsed as part of strings.  You must use `XML` string type to parse literal XML content or use DOM.
- Fixed C++ JSON/XML-RPC API `time_t` type usage to `ULONG64` to ensure portability.  This affects the `value(time_t)` constructor, the `value::operator=(time_t)` assignment operator, and `value::operator time_t()` cast, which have been replaced by versions using `ULONG64`.  To use these in C++ for `time_t` ISO 8601 date time serialization, simply cast `time_t` values to `ULONG64` values.
- Fixed gsoapWinInet.cpp:243, `pDst` should be `a_pDst`.
- Fixed SNI `SSL_set_tlsext_host_name` call for OpenSSL 0.9.8f.
- Fixed `soap_instantiate` of smart pointer when instantiating derived class by *`xsi:type`*.
- Fixed friend `__declspec(dllexport)` declarations in generated classes.

Version 2.8.29 (02/24/2016)
---
- Added new soapcpp2 option `-r` to generate a soapReadme.md report that summarizes the input .h file information, the serializable C/C++ types, the services, and the generated code. Use a markdown converter to browse or download the free readmeviewer.html from https://www.genivia.com/files/readmeviewer.html.zip to view the soapReadme.md report in a browser.
- Added new wsdl2h option `-M` to suppress error "must understand element with wsdl:required='true'".
- Upgraded HTTP digest authentication `httpda` plugin to 2.0 to support RFC7616 "HTTP Digest Access Authentication" with SHA2 (replacing MD5) that is compatible with RFC2617; compile and link upgraded `plugin/httpda.c` with `plugin/smdevp.c` instead of `plugin/md5evp.c`.
- Updated wsdl2h HTTPS-enabled build steps to use upgraded `httpda` plugin.
- Updated `samples/webserver` to use upgraded `httpda` plugin.
- Updated the samples with new AWS S3 SOAP API example `samples/aws`.
- Improved soapcpp2 code generation of inline object read/write functions in C++, instead of macros generated in C.
- Fixed and improved soapcpp2 code generation with options `-p` and `-q`.
- Fixed definitions/service/port/wsaw:UsingAddressing processing.
- Fixed SNI `SSL_set_tlsext_host_name` call for OpenSSL 0.9.8f.
- Fixed wsdl2h skipping *`mime:multipartRelated/mime:part`*.

Version 2.8.30 (04/02/2016)
---

- Added backtick XML tag name syntax to interface files for soapcpp2, which allows for the overriding of the translated tag names of struct/class members and service operation parameters, see the [Data Bindings documentation](https://www.genivia.com/doc/databinding/html#toxsd9-5). Older gSOAP versions do not support the backtick tag in the generated WSDL and schemas (messages are OK).
- Added macro `SOAP_MAXLEVEL` to trigger `SOAP_LEVEL` error when XML nesting level of inbound XML exceeds the value of `SOAP_MAXLEVEL`.  Default value is 10000.  Redefine `SOAP_MAXLEVEL` as needed, with lower values to restrict XML nesting depth for receivers to accept.
- Added macro `SOAP_MAXLENGTH` to trigger `SOAP_LENGTH` content length error when string content in inbound XML exceeds the value of `SOAP_MAXLENGTH`.  Applies to strings that are potentially unbounded, i.e. that are not already constrained by XML validation maxLength constaints (which could be larger than `SOAP_MAXLENGTH`).  Default value is zero (0) which means that string length is unconstrained if XML validation maxLength is not given.  Redefine `SOAP_MAXLENGTH` as needed, with lower values to restrict string lengths for receivers to accept.
- Added macro `SOAP_MAXOCCURS` to trigger `SOAP_OCCURS` content error when array and container lengths exceed the value of `SOAP_MAXOCCURS`.  Must be greater than zero (0).  Default value is 100000.  Redefine `SOAP_MAXOCCURS` as needed, with lower values to restrict array and container lengths for receivers to accept.
- Updated wsdl2h WS-Policy processing to include WS-RM protocol versioning.
- Updated `soap_ignore_element` processing efficiency.
- Updated `import/saml1.h` and `import/saml2.h`.
- Improved soapcpp2 generation of WSDL and XSD for unqualified C/C++ types or when mixing qualified and unqualified C/C++ types and type names.
- Changed soapcpp2 default behavior for generating WSDL and XSD files with *`elementFormDefault="unqualified"`* from the old default behavior with *`elementFormDefault="qualified"`*, i.e. when `//gsoap ns elementForm:` directive is NOT explicitly included in the interface .h file for soapcpp2 and when soapcpp2 option -e is not used.  *This change DOES NOT affect interface files produced by wsdl2h*, only those interface .h files that are not auto-generated and do not have elementForm directives.  *If you use soapcpp2 to generate WSDL and schemas AND you need backward compatible SOAP document/literal style messaging AND you DO NOT have `//gsoap ns service style: rpc` (or soapcpp2 option -e) AND you DO NOT have `//gsoap ns schema elementForm:` directives already in your .h file, then you SHOULD add `//gsoap ns schema elementForm: qualified` directives to your .h file for each `ns` prefix*.  This recommendation ensures backward compatibility in your current SOAP document/literal style messaging projects.  Changing the soapcpp2 default behavior to *`elementFormDefault="unqualified"`* simplifies data bindings.  It is also the accurate form to use when C/C++ types are not namespace qualified in the .h interface file for soapcpp2.
- Improved DLL export with compiler flag `/DSOAP_STD_EXPORTS` (which defines `SOAP_STD_EXPORTS`) to dllexport the API, classes, and the proxy and service classes.  Modified the plugins to support dllexport.
- Fixed soapcpp2 crash with enum constants > 255 due to libc `isalpha` crashing on some Linux systems.
- Fixed `import/wsp.h` soapcpp2 compilation error.
- Fixed soapcpp2 option `-w` that may cause a message response element tag name inconsistency with SOAP doc/lit style.
- Fixed deserialization issue with dynamic arrays of STL containers/smart-pointers (i.e. a pointer to an array of containers/smart-pointers, which is an unlikely combination to use, but should work).

Version 2.8.31 (05/1/2016)
---

- Added engine context `sndbuf` and `rcvbuf` attributes to (re)set `setsockopt` values for `SO_SNDBUF` and `SO_RCVBUF`, respectively.  Default value is `SOAP_BUFLEN`, same as engine's internal message buffer size.  Setting to zero forces the engine to omit the `setsockopt` `SO_SNDBUF` and `SOAP_RCVBUF` calls, which for example can be used to enable TCP buffer autotuning with Linux (Linux 2.4 and up).
- Added "http://userid:passwd@domain/path" userinfo syntax for HTTP Basic and NTLM authentication, i.e. this automatically sets `soap->userid` and `soap->passwd` from the userinfo and also sets `soap->authrealm` to the domain if not already set. HTTP Basic authentication is not recommended without secure https. For NTLM authentication, set `soap->ntlm_challenge = ""` to proceed immediately with NTLM instead of Basic authentication.
- Improved strengthening of `SOAP_XML_STRICT` and the soapcpp2 `-s` flag to reject all extra (non-deserializable) XML and character data by the parser and deserializers.
- Improved client-side certificate checking (DNS or IP, and wildcards).
- Improved soapcpp2 option `-t` and `//gsoap ns schema typed: y` directive that force the addition of *`xsi:type`* attributes to XML content except for types whose type names are prefixed with an underscore (i.e. root elements w/o type as per wsdl2h data bindings rules).
- Fixed crash with nested dynamic arrays in C++ (C is fine) i.e. classes and structs with `__ptr` and `__size` members as arrays of elements, where these arrays contain nested dynamic arrays.  [See here for patch](https://www.genivia.com/advisory.html).
- Fixed typedef of `xsd__hexBinary` struct/class, which should map to hexBinary but instead mapped to base64Binary.
- Fixed `nc` and `cnonce`, which are removed when `qop` directive is absent in HTTP digest authentication as per RFC2617.
- Fixed the digest authentication plugin from blocking basic authentication.
- Fixed soapcpp2 naming of unnamed function/method parameters as `_param_N` with N now counting up sequentially *per function* instead of globally counting up.  Use soapcpp2 option `-z3` for backward compatible global parameter indexing.
- Fixed (smart) pointer deserialization of non-base (derived) objects that are XML serialized with SOAP id-ref encoding using a href/ref that references a derived object (i.e. should result in a (smart) pointer to a derived instance, not a base instance or missing instance).
- Fixed strict validation (`SOAP_XML_STRICT`) of unqualified attributes in elements with a default namespace.
- Fixed wsdl2h 2.8.28-30 parsing of *`xs:unique`* causing wsdl2h to skip over schema components.  The fix also improved string-based parsing of XML content with a fix for 2.8.28-30 XML string handling.

Version 2.8.32 (05/10/2016)
---

- Improved soapcpp2 code generation of type converters `int soap_s2T(soap*, const char*, T*)` and `const char *soap_T2s(soap*, T)` for primitive and binary types T.
- Fixed unqualified *`xsi:type`* content matching with default namespace, which may lead to a failure in the 2.8.31 release to instantiate derived instances for complexType extensions.
- Fixed Solaris-specific memory issues in `soap_wstrdup`.

Version 2.8.33 (06/14/2016)
---

- Updated WS-Trust gsoap/import/wstx.h `__wst__RequestSecurityToken` response message parameter to `wst__RequestSecurityTokenResponseCollection`
- Updated WS-Security gsoap/import/wsse.h with optional SAML assertions in the Security header.
- Updated response processing for empty HTTP body with HTTP code 200 to 202: no longer forces socket close when HTTP keep-alive is enabled.
- Updated `_XML` literal string XML serialization for qualified tag names, no longer uses default namespace (as in *`xmlns="URI"`*) but a prefixed tag name only.
- Updated wsdl2h options `-p` and `-d`, now generates `xsd__anyType*` (i.e. with pointer) data members without requiring the user to define a typemap.dat rule to do so. This change reinstates some of the old behavior of 2.8.23 and earlier versions.
- Fixed wsddapi.c compilation issue on Windows (`usleep` replaced).
- Fixed validation of *`simpleType/restriction/length`* when restriction base is a list that is mapped to a string.
- Fixed validation of *`simpleType/restriction`* with base type string length bounds restrictions.

Version 2.8.34 (08/17/2016)
---

- Added custom serializers for QT primitive types and QT containers.  This serializes many QT types directly in XML.  The QT types to use for XSD types are specified in the typemap.dat.  See the updated gsoap/typemap.dat file in the distribution package and the updated [databindings](https://www.genivia.com/doc/databinding/html) documentation for details.
- Added HTTP server session management plugin to manage server-side session cookies.
- Added basic common WADL support to wsdl2h to generate code for WADL REST XML applications.
- Improved client-side URL query generation and support for URL templates for REST operations.
- Updated the iOS plugin and its Web service examples.
- Updated SSL calls for improved iOS portability.
- Updated wsdl2h headerfault support (optional fault details in SOAP Headers, not widely used by Web services tools).
- Updated VC++ ISAPI plugin.
- Fixed `soap_send_empty_response()` with HTTP keep-alive to prevent exit of the server loop back to `soap_accept()`, i.e. prematurely killing the keep-alive connection causing EOF/RST.
- Fixed `#import "wsse.h"` in `gsoap/import/ds.h` by moving it down to avoid missing type declaration of `_ds__KeyInfo` which may cause a soapcpp2 syntax error.
- Fixed WS-Security interoperability issues, fixes issues with XML encryption. Token handler callback has new parameters to pass the key data of SecurityTokenReference/KeyIdentifier.
- Fixed the internal `feltbegout` and `feltendout` callbacks: when set no longer emits XML and (alternative) output is expected to be emitted by these callbacks.

Version 2.8.35 (09/19/2016)
---

- Added auto-generation of new C functions `T * soap_new_T(struct soap*, int n)` to allocate and default initialize one (or more with `n>1`) value(s) of type `T`. Uses `soap_malloc(soap, n * sizeof(T))` and applies `soap_default_T(struct soap*, T*)` to each value allocated.
- Added WS-Trust wst extensible framework with SAML 1.0/2.0 tokens, PSHA1 algorithm, and an example WS-Trust client and server to request, create, sign, and verify SAML 2.0 tokens.
- Changed `soap_new_block` to `soap_alloc_block` in stdsoap2.h and in the gsoap libs to prevent potential name clashes with generated code for a `block` type.
- Improved UDP connectivity with WS-Discovery to reuse current socket connection, i.e. preventing premature socket close when `soap->socket` is the `soap->master` socket.
- Fixed wsdl2h option `-u` to prevent a deserialization issue that occurs in the specific case of an *`<xs:any>`* within a *`<xs:choice maxOccurs="unbounded">`*.

Version 2.8.36 (09/21/2016)
---

- Fixed a problem with `SOAP_ENV__Header` missing in wsdl2h-generated .h file (problem occurs with 2.8.34/35 due to an update for headerfaults).

Version 2.8.37 (10/25/2016)
---

- Added server-side HTTP cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) access control using HTTP OPTIONS `fopt()` callback.
- Fixed `make -j n` parallel builds.
- Fixed an issue causing UDP message fragmentation.
- Fixed `soap_mq` message queue plugin dropping connections.
- Fixed missing nested [] in arrayType value in SOAP 1.1 encoding (SOAP 1.2 not affected).

Version 2.8.38 (11/11/2016)
---

- Added auto-generated client-side REST API functions to simplify REST GET, PUT, POST operations with XML data: `soap_GET_T`, `soap_PUT_T`, `soap_POST_send_T`, and `soap_POST_recv_T` for XML elements/types `T`.  Also `soap_DELETE` REST DELETE added.  See [get started](http://www.genivia.com/dev.html#services) on how to use these functions.
- Updated samples/webserver to use both the httpform and httppost plugins to serve HTML form data and REST PUT, POST, DELETE operations for the updated samples/rest example person.c and person.cpp clients.

Version 2.8.39 (11/17/2016)
---

- Minor improvements: the engine sets the temporary "C" locale for floating point conversion on most systems.  This is now the default on most systems, rather than an option.  To disable, compile source code with `-DWITH_NO_C_LOCALE`.  To enable, compile with `-DWITH_C_LOCALE`.  As before, the setting is temporary and thread-local in the engine so it does not affect the application's locale.

Version 2.8.40 (12/10/2016)
---

- Improved wsdl2h import/include relative path search.
- Fixed wsdl2h schema import when imports are deeply nested in imports/includes.
- Fixed MinGW compilation issue.

Version 2.8.41 (01/11/2017)
---

- Added updates to support OpenSSL 1.1.0.
- Added HTTP header `Accept: multipart/related,application/xop+xml,*/*;q=0.8` when MTOM is expected (i.e. when the input mode flag is set to `SOAP_ENC_MTOM`).
- Improved CORS internals and compatibility.
- Fixed minor issues with `WITH_NOIO` and `WITH_NO_C_LOCALE`.
- Fixed bug in XML attribute serialization of QT QByteArray and QString types.
- Fixed WinCE7 `IP_MULTICAST_IF` issue.

Version 2.8.42 (01/20/2017)
---

- Improved `WITH_REPLACE_ILLEGAL_UTF8` flag to compile the source code of the gSOAP libraries:  this replaces illegal UTF-8 input/output with the replacement character U+FFFD (or define your own `SOAP_UNKNOWN_UNICODE_CHAR`).
- Fixed shared pointer to QName string QName output normalization.
- Fixed wsdl2h pointer member to vector for minOccurs="0" by removing the unnecessary pointer to the container, i.e. just using the container.

Version 2.8.43 (02/05/2017)
---

- Added `SSL_CTX_need_tmp_RSA()` check (OpenSSL 1.0.1 and greater).
- Fixed string length limiting issue in QT QString type serializer `custom/qstring.h` and addressed compilation issue with other QT types serializers.
- Fixed documentation of `soap_copy_stream()` followed by `soap_free_stream()` to chain services.
- Fixed `soap_psha1` string buffering.

Version 2.8.44 upd (03/04/2017)
---

- Improved windows portability and stability.
- Fixed WS-Discovery `soap_wsdd_listen` memory cleanup on timeouts.
- Fixed `soap->os` saved message string NUL termination (a problem in C code, not in C++).
- Fixed Cygwin and MinGW missing xlocale.h error.

Version 2.8.45 upd (04/07/2017)
---

- Fixed an issue with the WSSE plugin that caused WS-Security SignedInfo/Reference/Transforms/Transform/InclusiveNamespaces/@PrefixList ending up being ignored by the canonicalizer.
- Fixed Windows and WinCE compilation issues.
- Improvements.

Version 2.8.46 (05/16/2017)
---

- Improved WS-Trust API, updated import/wst.h, import/saml1.h, import/saml2.h and import/wsdd.h definitions.
- Added `soap.client_interface` string to set the client IP address interface with `inet_pton()` (not generally available on windows).
- Fixes for minor issues, improvements.

Version 2.8.47 (06/07/2017)
---

- Added CURL plugin to use libcurl for gSOAP client applications.
- Fixed spurious occurrences of `<root/>` elements in XML renderings of DOM nodes.
- Improvements.

Version 2.8.48 upd (06/21/2017)
---

- Improved element and attribute `default` and `fixed` value validation.  Changed the code generation by wsdl2h slightly for optional elements with default values.  This fixes an issue when an optional element is omitted in XML and becomes indistinguishable from an empty element because in both cases a default value is assigned.  An omitted optional element has no default value.  New XML validation error codes `SOAP_FIXED` and `SOAP_EMPTY`.
- Added `soap->transfer_timeout` max transfer timeout, to use in combination with `soap->send_timeout` and `soap->recv_timeout`.
- Fixed a potential vulnerability that may be exposed with a large and specific XML message over 2 GB in size.  After receiving this 2 GB message, a buffer overflow can cause an open unsecured server to crash.  Clients communicating with HTTPS with trusted servers are not affected.

Version 2.8.49 upd (07/11/2017)
---

- Improved JSON API to compile with XML data bindings, see updated JSON API documentation on "Compiling XML-RPC/JSON together with gSOAP XML data binding code"
- Improved white space handling of built-in XSD types that have "replace" and "collapse" white space properties. Further, types derived from these built-in XSD types will now inherit the white space "replace" or "collapse" property, meaning that white space of inbound strings are normalized (`xsd__anyURI`, `xsd__language` `xsd__ENTITY`, `xsd__ENTITIES`, `xsd__ID`, `xsd__IDREF`, `xsd__IDREFS`, `xsd__Name`, `xsd__NCName`, `xsd__NMTOKEN`, `xsd__NMTOKENS`, `xsd__normalizedString`, `xsd__token`, etc).
- Fixed a memory leak in the deserializer of `std::vector<xsd__anyType>` (and dynamic arrays of `xsd__anyType`) where `xsd__anyType` is a DOM node imported with `#import "dom.h"`.
- Fixed WSSE plugin recanonicalization of inclusive C14N SignedInfo.
- Fixes for minor issues, improvements.

Version 2.8.50 (07/23/2017) {#latest}
---

- Added samples/atom Atom 1.0 XML REST example.
- Added `soap->recv_maxlength` to change the limit on the length of messages received.  Default is 2GB max.  Greater lengths are possible, but at your own risk.  It is strongly recommended to deploy services in uncontrolled environments with the [Apache module](https://www.genivia.com/doc/apache/html/index.html) and [ISAPI extension](https://www.genivia.com/doc/isapi/html/index.html), see the gSOAP [tutorial](https://www.genivia.com/tutorials.html) and [documentation](https://www.genivia.com/docs.html).
- Removed client-side `SOAP_PURE_VIRTUAL` from `copy()` in the code generated by soapcpp2 for options `-i` and `-j`.
- Updated memory deallocation of `soap_del_xsd__anyAttribute`.
- Updated the callback function signatures of `fpost` and `fresponse`.
- Improvements.
