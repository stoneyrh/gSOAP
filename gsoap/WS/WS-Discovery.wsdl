  <!-- If this portType is included in EndpointReference/Types, it
       indicates the Target Service is a Discovery Proxy.  Because
       this specification does not define proxy-specific operations,
       no operations are defined within this portType; Discovery
       Proxies implement other types that define proxy-specific
       operations.  Discovery Proxies also implement
       TargetService. -->
