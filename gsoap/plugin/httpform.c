This program is released under the GPL with the additional exemption that
compiling, linking, and/or using OpenSSL is allowed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Compile & link with stand-alone gSOAP server.

        Usage (server side):
        struct soap soap;
        soap_init(&soap);
        soap_register_plugin_arg(&soap, http_form, http_form_handler);
        ...
        ... = soap_copy(&soap); // copies plugin too but not its data: plugin data is shared since fcopy is not set
        ...
        soap_done(&soap); // detach plugin (calls plugin->fdelete)

        You need to define a HTTP handling function at the server-side:
        int http_form_handler(struct soap*)
        which will be called from the plugin upon an HTTP POST request that
        matches the application/x-www-form-urlencoded content-type.
        The function should return an error code or SOAP_STOP to prevent the
        gSOAP engine from processing the message body;

        To parse form data in the handler, use:

        char *s = soap_http_get_form(soap);
        while (s)
        {
          char *key = soap_query_key(soap, &s); // decode next form string key
          char *val = soap_query_val(soap, &s); // decode next form string value (if any)
          ...
        }

        The soap_http_get_form() function reads an HTTP body and stores it in an
        internal buffer that is returned as a char*. This buffer can be used to
        process HTTP POST body content. The soap_query_key/val functions simply
        extract key-value pairs from this buffer.

        The handler should also produce a valid HTTP response, for example:
        soap_response(soap, SOAP_HTML); // use this to return HTML ...
        soap_response(soap, SOAP_OK); // ... or use this to return a SOAP message
        ...
        soap_send(soap, "<HTML>...</HTML>"); // example HTML
        ...
        soap_end_send(soap);

        See samples/webserver for an example HTTP POST form handling server.

        Warning: this plugin MUST be registered AFTER the httppost plugin.
