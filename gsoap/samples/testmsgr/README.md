============

It is important to test Web services and client applications as part of a
quality assurance process.  Furthermore, the functional and non-functional
requirements of an application should be verified and tested before the
application is deployed in the field.  Testing Web services with randomized
message exchange patterns can help to pinpoint problems early on, before
applications are deployed.

The benefit of the Test Messenger is the ability to use a set of message
templates for unit and regression testing, with specific randomization of
XML attribute and element values in the templates as specified.

The Test Messenger is an application to test Web services by sending
(randomized) XML test messages to services and client applications.  The Test
Messenger application is simply executed from the command line or from a shell
script, such as a script intended to test services and clients.  No coding is
required to use the Test Messenger.

The testmsgr Test Messenger application is located in the gSOAP distribution
package under `gsoap/samples/testmsgr` and is built with:

    cd gsoap/samples/testmsgr
    make

To generate randomized XML messages with the Test Messenger, a SOAP/XML message
template is required.  The Test Messenger populates the template with random
values to send the randomly populated SOAP/XML request message to a service for
\ref servers.  Or the Test Messenger can be started as a stand-alone server to
return the randomly populated response message template to a client for \ref
clients.

You can create a SOAP/XML message template manually or auto-generate it with
soapcpp2 option `-g`.  For example, to auto-generate XML sample message
templates from an interface header file `file.h` (e.g. generated with wsdl2h
from WSDLs), use soapcpp2 with option `-g`:

    soapcpp2 -g file.h

The soapcpp2 tool generates sample messages for the service operations defined
in `file.h`.  Option `-g` changes the sample message to message templates that
contain placeholders of the form `%[...]%`.  A leading `???` qualifier
indicates optional elements and attributes.  Repeated elements are indicated
and enclosed as child elements in `<__REPEAT>` ... `</__REPEAT>`.  Element
selections are indicated and enclosed in `<__SELECT>` ... `</__SELECT>`.

A placeholder value `%[...]%` specifies an XSD-related type, enumeration, or
numeric range.  These placeholders are populated by the Test Messenger using
random values that conform to the placeholder's specified value type.

While the sample messages generated by soapcpp2 (without option `-g`) can be
used to test clients and services as explained in the gSOAP user guide, the
problem is that the content of the sample messages is always fixed.  This
provides only very limited testing capabilities.  By contrast, the Test
Messenger application generates randomized messages based on SOAP/XML message
templates for enhanced testing of client and service applications.

The Test Messenger is intended to test common messaging scenarios that are
defined by SOAP/XML message templates.  The Test Messenger does not add
(random) XML attributes and elements that are not already in the message
template.  It can randomly remove attributes and elements with option `-p` to
test the robustness of an application to consuming partial and possibly invalid
XML messages (invalid according to the schema of the XML message).

The Test Messenger has several options to further randomize the messages by
randomly removing attributes and elements at a specific rate of chance, or to
add random spacing to XML attribute and element values, and to continuously
test a service until it fails.

To demonstrate the Test Messenger, assume we have the following services
declared in the interface `file.h`:

```cpp
//gsoap ns service name:      example
//gsoap ns service namespace: urn:example

#import "custom/struct_tm.h"        // use struct tm for xsd:dateTime

typedef std::string xsd__ID;        // declare xsd:ID type (whitespace collapsed)
typedef std::string xsd__Name;      // declare xsd:Name type (whitespace collapsed)
typedef xsd__Name ns__name 1:80;    // restrict xsd:Name to a name with 1 to 80 chars
typedef float ns__miles 0: ;        // restrict xsd:float to non-negative

enum ns__gender { male, female };

struct ns__person
{
  @xsd__ID        id;
  ns__name        firstname;
  ns__name        lastname;
  xsd__dateTime   dob;
  enum ns__gender gender;
  ns__miles      *miles;
};

int ns__upload(struct ns__person *person, xsd__ID& id);   // upload to DB

int ns__download(xsd__ID id, struct ns__person& person);  // download from DB
```

We run soapcpp2 on this interface `file.h` with option `-g`:

    soapcpp2 -g file.h

This produces the following SOAP/XML template files among other source code
files:

- `example.upload.req.xml` XML template upload request message
- `example.download.req.xml` XML template download request message
- `example.upload.res.xml` XML template upload response message
- `example.download.res.xml` XML template download response message

The `example.upload.req.xml` file looks like this:

<div class="alt">
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope
  xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"
  xmlns:SOAP-ENC="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
  xmlns:ns="urn:example">
 <SOAP-ENV:Body>
  <ns:upload>
   <person id="???%[[ID]]%">???
    <firstname>%[[NAME[1:80]]]%</firstname>
    <lastname>%[[NAME[1:80]]]%</lastname>
    <dob>%[[DATETIME]]%</dob>
    <gender>%[[male][female]]%</gender>
    <miles>???%[[0.000000E+00:3.402823E+38]]%</miles>
   </person>
  </ns:upload>
 </SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
```
</div>

Note that XML values in this template are represented by value placeholders of
the form `%[...]%`.  Also note that the `person` element, the `id` attribute
and `miles` are optional.

A leading `???` qualifier indicates optional elements and attributes, when the
`???` qualifier appears after the opening tag of an element (i.e. in front of
the element value or child elements) and in attribute values, respectively.
For the full list of placeholders that can be used, see \ref placeholder.

This message template is read, populated and then sent to the standard output
by testmsgr as follows:

    ./testmsgr -r1 -i example.upload.req.xml

<div class="alt">
```

</div>

This produced a randomized SOAP/XML message to standard output from the
`example.upload.req.xml` template message.  Option `-r1` sets the random seed
to `1`.  Any seed value between 1 and 2147483647 can be specified with `-r`.
Option `-i` displays the randomized XML with indentation.

To randomly retain and omit optional elements and attributes, use option `-q`
with a specified percentage to retain optional elements and attributes in the
generated XML message:

    ./testmsgr -r1 -q50 -i example.upload.req.xml

This retains the optional element `person`, the `id` attribute, and the `miles`
element with a 50% chance each.

To send the randomized SOAP/XML message to a service endpoint, pass the
endpoint URL as the last argument to the testmsgr command:

    ./testmsgr -r1 -i example.upload.req.xml http://www.example.com/service

For example, we can let soapcpp2 generate a simple echo test service to which
we can send messages.  Since we auto-generate a simple echo test service we
have no server-side logic to return meaningful values for this example.

First we invoke soapcpp2 with option `-T` to generate the server-side code for
a simple test service:

    soapcpp2 -g -SL -T file.h

This generates the SOAP/XML message templates and the following source code
files:

- `example.wsdl` a WSDL to publish the service
- `example.nsmap` an XML namespace mapping table to include in your source code
- `soapStub.h` annotated copy of the source interface file
- `soapH.h` serialization functions
- `soapC.cpp` serialization functions
- `soapServer.cpp` service request dispatcher
- `soapTester.cpp` auto-test echo server

Next, we compile these files together with the gSOAP library and the custom
serializer for `struct tm` to build a simple echo server:

    c++ -I. -o echoserver soapTester.cpp soapServer.cpp soapC.cpp stdsoap2.cpp custom/struct_tm.c

Now run the server.  For example with arguments 8080 as the port to bind to and
8192 to set the `SOAP_XML_INDENT` engine context flag:

    ./echoserver 8192 8080

Finally, let's fire a randomized message to the simple echo service, using the
auto-generated `example.upload.req.xml` message template:

    ./testmsgr -r1 example.upload.req.xml http://localhost:8080

<div class="alt">
```
Random seed = 1
Server response:

---- begin ----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:SOAP-ENC="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:ns="urn:example">
        <SOAP-ENV:Body>
                <ns:uploadResponse>
                        <id></id>
                </ns:uploadResponse>
        </SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>

---- end ----
```
</div>

The testmsgr displays the response received from the server, which for the
simple echo service upload request is the upload response with an id element.

To send a continuous stream of randomized message to the server, use option
`-c`:

    ./testmsgr -c -r1 example.upload.req.xml http://localhost:8080

This continous until the service fails.  A test is reproduced by using its
random seed.  So if the service fails you can replicate the message with the
random seed and option `-r` with this seed value.

The Test Messenger application can also send pruned XML messages with option
`-p`.  Pruning means that attributes and elements are randomly omitted, which
allows for testing the robustness of the service against incomplete and
malformed SOAP/XML content:

    ./testmsgr -c -p100 -r1 example.upload.req.xml http://localhost:8080

Option `-p100` means a one in 100 change that an attribute or element is
omitted from the SOAP/XML template `example.upload.req.xml`.

When testing the auto-test echo service, the echo service displays failed
requests and is silent for successful requests.

Installing testmsgr                                                     {#build}
===================

To build testmsgr, [install gSOAP](http://www.genivia.com/downloads.html) and
build testmsgr as follows:

    cd gsoap/samples/testmsgr
    make testmsgr

This builds the command-line tool testmsgr in `gsoap/samples/testmsgr` from where you
can use it and/or copy it for use with your projects.

If you do not have the samples built, you can use soapcpp2 (or soapcpp2.exe
in `gsoap/bin/win32`) from the command line to generate the C++ code required
for testmsgr:

    cd gsoap/samples/testmsgr
    soapcpp2 -CSL ../../import/dom.h
    c++ -I../.. -o testmsgr testmsgr.cpp soapC.cpp ../../dom.cpp ../../stdsoap2.cpp

This builds the testmsgr command-line tool.

Using testmsgr                                                          {#using}
==============

The testmsgr command takes a set of options, a SOAP/XML message file or a
message template file (i.e. to randomize with option `-r`), and an optional
service endpoint URL.

Server-side testing                                                   {#servers}
-------------------

To test services, run testmsgr against the service endpoint URL, for example
when the service runs on the localhost on port 8080:

    ./testmsgr -r99 example.upload.req.xml http://localhost:8080

When using https endpoints, you must build testmsgr with compile-time flag
`WITH_OPENSSL` and link OpenSSL as follows:

    soapcpp2 -CSL ../../import/dom.h
    c++ -DWITH_OPENSSL -o testmsgr testmsgr.cpp soapC.cpp ../../dom.cpp ../../stdsoap2.cpp -lssl -lcrypto

For CGI-based services that read SOAP/XML requests from standard input you can
redirect the (randomized) message to the CGI-based service.  For example:

    ./testmsgr -r99 example.upload.req.xml | ./echoserver

where echoserver is a CGI-based service (the echoserver built in the \ref intro
uses CGI by default).

Client-side testing                                                   {#clients}
-------------------

To test clients, run testmsgr as a stand-alone server by specifying a port
number instead of a service endpoint URL:

    ./testmsgr -r1 example.download.res.xml 8080

This runs the Test Messenger on port 8080.  The Test Messenger discards request
messages sent by clients and returns randomized responses using the SOAP/XML
`example.download.res.xml` response message template.

You can also use file redirection to test clients when your client uses the
"http://" endpoint URL without a domain.  By using this URL your client writes
HTTP messages to standard output and reads HTTP responses from standard input.
For example:

    ./testmsgr -r1 example.download.res.xml > response.xml
    ./client < response.xml > /dev/null

where the testmsgr command-line options are:

Option    | Description
--------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------
`-a act`  | use HTTP SOAP Action header value `"act"`
`-b`      | add random spacing to randomized values when using `-r`
`-c`      | continue testing until the service endpoint fails
`-h`      | display help message
`-i`      | indent XML with spaces when using `-r`
`-j`      | indent XML with tabs when using `-r`
`-l max`  | max number of randomized element repeats (default is 3)
`-m max`  | max length of randomized text values generated (default is 255)
`-n len`  | display the server response up to len bytes
`-o file` | save to file
`-p perc` | percentage XML kept when using -r (default=100)
`-q perc` | percentage XML kept of optional indicators when using -r (default=100)
`-r seed` | randomize XML message templates (use soapcpp2 `-g`)
`-t sec`  | socket idle timeout seconds (default is one second)
`-v`      | verbose mode
`-R rep`  | set XML element sequence indicator tag (default=`__REPEAT`)
`-S sel`  | set XML element selection indicator tag (default=`__SELECT`)
`infile`  | XML message template
`-`       | read XML from standard input
`URL`     | endpoint URL of service to test
`port`    | stand-alone server port for clients to test

More specifically, `infile` is an SOAP/XML message file (or message template
file), `-` specifies that the message should be read from standard input, and
`URL` is the optional service endpoint to send (randomized) messages to.  When
a `port` number is specified instead of a URL, testmsgr runs as a stand-alone
application to test clients that connect to it.  A client application receives
the (randomized) message generated by testmsgr from the specified SOAP/XML
message file (or message template file).

### `-a act`

Use HTTP SOAP Action header value `"act"` with the SOAP request messages sent.
This option is required for services that require a SOAP Action header.

### `-b`

Add random blank spacing to randomized values when using option `-r`.

### `-c`

Continue testing of a service until the service fails, i.e. until the server at
the specified endpoint URL becomes unresposive.

### `-h`

Display help message.

### `-i`

Indent XML with spaces when using option `-r`.

### `-j`

Indent XML with tabs when using option `-r`.

### `-l max`

Specifies the max number of randomized element repetitions for `__SEQ` and
`__SEL` with min and max indicators, when using option `-r`.  The default is 3.
The maximum value that can be specified is 18446744073709551615.

### `-m max`

Specifies the max length of randomized text values generated when using option
`-r`.  The default is 255.  The maximum value that can be specified is
18446744073709551615.

### `-n len`

Display the server response up to `len` bytes.  `-n0` removes the server
responses.  Omitting this option displays the full response.

### `-o file`

Save output to file.  This option is not applicable when `URL` or `port` are
specified.

### `-p perc`

Retain XML with the specified percentage chance, when using option `-r`.  XML
attributes and elements are removed by chance as specified.  For example,
`-p10` keeps only roughly 10% of the XML elements and attributes of the
original message.  The default is 100 (retain all XML).

### `-q perc`

Retain XML qualified with `???` and elements repeated with the `__REPEAT`
indicator with the specified percentage chance, when using option `-r`.  For
example, if a message has an element or attribute value `???%[[INT32]]` then
`-q10` keeps the element or attribute with a 10% chance.  Likewise, optional
XML elements enclosed in `<__REPEAT>` as indicated with `min` and `max` bounds
are kept with a 10% chance.  The default is 100 (retain).

### `-r seed`

Randomize the SOAP/XML message template given as the `infile` argument.
SOAP/XML message templates can be auto-generated with soapcpp2 option `-g`.
The `seed` value is required and is used to reproduce test messages. Any
positive seed value can be specified, from 1 up to 2147483647.

### `-t sec`

Sets a socket idle timeout in seconds.  The default is one second.  A service
is considered unresponsive when a socket timeout occurs while messages are
exchanged.

### `-v`

Enable verbose mode.

### `-R rep`

Sets the XML element repetition indicator tag.  The default is `__REPEAT`.
See \ref indicators.

### `-S sel`

Sets the XML element selection indicator tag.  The default is `__SELECT`.
See \ref indicators.

Message templates                                                   {#templates}
=================

A SOAP/XML message template file is required when sending randomized messages
with testmsgr option `-r`.  The SOAP/XML message template file can be
auto-generated with soapcpp2 option `-g` on a interface file.  This interface
file is usually generated with wsdl2h from a (set of) WSDL and XSD file(s).
Note that option `-g` does not produce SOAP/XML message templates if the
interface file does not declare any service operations.

🔝 [Back to table of contents](#)

Placeholder values                                                {#placeholder}
------------------

Templates may contain placeholder values.  Placeholder values may start with
`???` meaning the value is optional, followed by the placeholder value type, an
enumeration, or a numeric range.  Values are inserted with testmsgr option
`-r`.

### Optional values

Element and attributes that are qualified as optional with `???` are randomly
omitted with options `-r` and `-q`, where `-q` specifies the percentage of
elements and attributes that are retained in the generated XML message.  A zero
percentage specified with `-q0` removes all optional values.  A value of 100
specified with `-q100` retains all optional values (the default) in the
generated XML message.

The `???` qualifier may appear after the opening tag of an element (i.e. in
front of the element value or child elements) and in attribute values.  For
example:

<div class="alt">
```xml
<ns:record xmlns:ns="urn:example" id="???[[INT32]]%">
  <name>???%[[TEXT]]%</name>
  <info>???
    <phone>%[[TEXT[1:20]]]%</phone>
    <email>%[[TEXT[1:40]]]%</email>
  </info>
  <data lang="%[[LANG]]%">???</data>
</ns:record>
  
```
</div>

where `id="???%[[INT32]]"` is an optional attribute with a 32-bit integer
value, `<name>???%[[TEXT]]%</name>` is an optional element with text,
`<contact>???` is an optional element with subelements, and
`<data lang="%[[LANG]]%">???</data>` is an optional empty element with an
attribute.

### Enumeration templates

`%[[A][B][C]]%` specifies a choice of values `A`, `B` or `C`.  The values can be
anything but should not contain `][` or `]]%`.  For example:

<div class="alt">
```xml
<process completed="%[[false][true]]%"/>
```
</div>

where `completed="%[[false][true]]%"` enumerates the values `false` and `true`.
Note that this enumeration is identical to the `%[[BOOL]]%` placeholder type.

### Numeric range templates

A numeric range is integer-valued when the lower bound `N` and upper bound `M`
are integer.  Otherwise, the numeric range values are floating point.  For
example, `%[[0:10]]%` speficies a range of integer values whereas
`%[[0.0:10.0]]%` specifies a range of floating point values.  The bounds of a
numeric range can be made exlusive by using `(` and `)` instead of `[` and `]`.

`%[[N:M]]%` specifies a range of integer or float values between `N` and `M`.

`%[[N:M)]%` specifies a range of integer or float values between `N` and `M` (exclusive).

`%[(N:M]]%` specifies a range of integer or float values between `N` (exclusive) and `M`.

`%[(N:M)]%` specifies a range of integer or float values between `N` (exclusive) and `M` (exclusive).

For example:

<div class="alt">
```xml
<price>%[(0.00:100000.00]]%</price>
```
</div>

where 0.00 is excluded from the float value range and `100000.00` is the
inclusive maximum.

### Primitive XSD type templates

`%[[BASE64]]%` and length-restricted `%[[BASE64[N:M]]]%` specify
xsd:base64Binary XSD values.  The length restriction `N:M` specifies the range
of base64-encoded bytes.

`%[[BOOL]]%` specifies xsd:boolean XSD values.

`%[[DATE]]%` specifies xsd:date XSD values.

`%[[DATETIME]]%` specifies xsd:dateTime XSD values.

`%[[DOUBLE]]%` specifies xsd:double XSD values.

`%[[DURATION]]%` specifies xsd:duration XSD values.

`%[[HEX]]%` and length-restricted `%[[HEX[N:M]]]%` specify xsd:hexBinary XSD
values.  The length restriction `N:M` specifies the range of encoded bytes, not
the number of hexadecimal characters.

`%[[ENTITY]]%` and length-restricted `%[[ENTITY[N:M]]]%` specify xsd:ENTITY XSD
values.  The range `N:M` specifies the number of characters.

`%[[ID]]%` and length-restricted `%[[ID[N:M]]]%` specify xsd:ID XSD values.
The range `N:M` specifies the number of characters.

`%[[IDREF]]%` and length-restricted `%[[IDREF[N:M]]]%` specify xsd:IDREF XSD
values.  The range `N:M` specifies the number of characters.

`%[[FLOAT]]%` specifies xsd:float XSD values.

`%[[INT8]]%` and `%[[BYTE]]%` specify xsd:byte XSD values.

`%[[INT16]]%` and `%[[SHORT]]%` specify xsd:short XSD values.

`%[[INT32]]%` and `%[[INT]]%` specify xsd:int XSD values.

`%[[INT64]]%` and `%[[LONG]]%` specify xsd:long XSD values.

`%[[LANG]]%` specifies xsd:language XSD values.

`%[[NAME]]%` and length-restricted `%[[NAME[N:M]]]%` specify xsd:Name XSD
values.  The range `N:M` specifies the number of characters.

`%[[NCNAME]]%` and length-restricted `%[[NCNAME[N:M]]]%` specify xsd:NCName XSD
values.  The range `N:M` specifies the number of characters.

`%[[NMTOKEN]]%` and length-restricted `%[[NMTOKEN[N:M]]]%` specify xsd:NMTOKEN
XSD values.  The range `N:M` specifies the number of characters.

`%[[TEXT]]%` and length-restricted `%[[TEXT[N:M]]]%` specify xsd:string,
xsd:normalizedString, xsd:anyURI, xsd:NOTATION, and xsd:token XSD values.  The

Element repetition and selection indicators                        {#indicators}
-------------------------------------------

Two special XML elements `__REPEAT` and `__SELECT` in message templates
indicate XML element repetitions and selections, respectively.  These elements
are processed by the Test Messenger to generate child elements, after which the
`__REPEAT` and `__SELECT` XML elements are removed from the generated
randomized XML messages.

### Repetition

Child elements of the `__REPEAT` indicator element are repeated within a range
specified by `min` and `max` attributes of the `__REPEAT` element.  The `min`
and `max` attributes are optional and default to 1 when omitted.  Option `-q`
controls the percentage of child elements that are generated within the range.
A zero percentage specified with `-q0` generates the minimum number of child
elements.  A value of 100 specified with `-q100` generates the maximum number
of child elements.  The maximum number of child elements (randomly) generated
is bounded by option `-l` (default is 3).  Therefore, the maximum number of
child elements is the greater of attribute `min` and the lesser of attribute
`max` and the value *lmax* specified with option `-l`:

> *min <= n <= maximum(min, minimum(max, lmax))*

where *n* is the number of child elements generated with a random probability
percentage specified by option `-q`.

For example, to repeat an `item` element with an integer value two or more
times use the `__REPEAT` indicator element with `item` as a child element:

<div class="alt">
```xml
<__REPEAT min="2" max="unbounded">
  <item>%[[INT32]]%</item>
</__REPEAT>
```
</div>

Assuming that testmsgr options `-r1`, `-l10` and `-q50` are used, the generated
XML message has at least two `item` elements and at most 10 elements, with on
average 50% of the elements kept between 2 (the `min` minimum) and 10 elements
(the maximum specified by `-l10`), i.e. 6 elements on average.  Each `item`
element has a random integer value.

### Selection

One child element of the `__SELECT` indicator element is randomly and uniformly
selected as an XML element for the generated randomized XML message.

For example, to select one element from the three choices of elements `A`, `B`
or `C`:

<div class="alt">
```xml
<__SELECT>
  <A>%[[INT32]]%</A>
  <B>%[[FLOAT]]%</B>
  <C>%[[TEXT]]%</C>
</__SELECT>
```
</div>

The generated XML message has either an `A` element with an integer value, a
`B` element with a floating point value, or a `C` element with a text value.

Note that the `???` qualifier can be used with child elements to make them
optional.
