Google API Web service example client application.

This application is deprecated: Google discontinued the distribution of keys
for their API service.

The Google API service provides a SOAP interface to the Google search engine.

The Google API SOAP server requires typed messages (xsi:type). The soapcpp2
option -t is used to generate the necessary type-enabled serializers.
