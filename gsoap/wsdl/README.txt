The gSOAP WSDL parser 'wsdl2h'

INSTRUCTIONS

The gSOAP WSDL parser converts one or more WSDLs into a gSOAP header file for
processing with the gSOAP soapcpp2 compiler to generate client stubs/proxies
and server skeletons/objects to access services or build new services.

For example:

$ wsdl2h -o XMethodsQuery.h http://www.xmethods.net/wsdl/query.wsdl

Note: if an error occurs when running wsdl2h, please try again later. The
XMethods site is very popular and suffers under load. It may also be the case
that XMethods removed certain services. In that case, try another on-line WSDL.

This generates the XMethodsQuery.h header file with Web service operations
and C++ data types. This header file is intended to be processed with soapcpp2
to generate the stub and/or skeleton code.

You need to have stlvector.h present in the current directory (stlvector.h is
in the package) to support STL vectors. To build without STL, use option -s:

$ wsdl2h -s -o XMethodsQuery.h http://www.xmethods.net/wsdl/query.wsdl

Or to build a pure C application, use option -c:

$ wsdl2h -c -o XMethodsQuery.h http://www.xmethods.net/wsdl/query.wsdl

Other useful options to control the output are -e and -y (see below).

The above commands are to be followed by the soapcpp2 compilation phase:

$ soapcpp2 -C XMethodsQuery.h

Where option -C indicates client-side only files (soapcpp2 generates both
client and server stubs and skeletons by default).

The generated XMethodsQuery.h includes the definitions of data types and
service operations of the XMethods Query Web service. To develop a C++ client
application, you can use the generated 'soapXMethodsQuerySoapProxy' class and
'XMethodsQuerySoap.nsmap' XML namespace table to access the Web service. Both
need to be '#include'd in your source. Then compile and link the soapC.cpp,
soapClient.cpp, and stdsoap2.cpp sources to complete the build. More
information on this process can be found in the gSOAP documentation.

When parsing a WSDL, the output file name is the WSDL input file name with
extension '.h' instead of '.wsdl'. When an input file is absent or a WSDL file
from a Web location is accessed, the header output will be produced on the
standard output. Input may also consist of schema files, which is useful when
you to need to generate code for serializing schema instances.

USING A TYPEMAP FILE TO CONTROL THE INPUT AND OUTPUT

The typemap.dat is the default file processed by 'wsdl2h' to customize the
generated header file output. The default typemap.dat file is located in the
'WS' directory. Use wsdl2h option -t to specify an alternate file.

The typemap.dat file can be used to define namespace prefix and type bindings
for the generated header files by the 'wsdl2h' tool. XML namespace prefix
bindings can be provided to override the default choice of the ns1, ns2, ...
prefixes generated by 'wsdl2h'. It is highly recommended to provide namespace
prefixes for your project's XML namespaces. In this way, changes to the WSDL
(or newer releases of wsdl2h) will have a minimal impact on coding.

Bindings for namespace prefixes in typemap.dat are of the form:
	prefix = "URI"

For example, to bind the 'google' prefix to the Google API's namespace:
	google = "urn:GoogleSearch"

Type bindings can by provided to bind XML schema types to C/C++ types for your
project.

Type bindings are of the form:
	prefix__type = declaration | use | ptr-use
where 'declaration' introduces the type in the header file, 'use' specifies how
the type is used directly, 'ptr-use' specifies how the type is used as a
pointer type.

For example:
	xsd__string = | char* | char*
After enabling this line, all XSD strings will be mapped to char* and since
char* is already a pointer type, the 'ptr-use' part is the same as 'use' part.
Note that the 'declaration' part is empty in these cases.

Member data and functions can be provided to extend a generated struct or
class.

Class and struct extensions are of the form:
	prefix__type = $ member-declaration

For example, to add a constructor and destructor to class myns__record:
	myns__record = $ myns__record();
	myns__record = $ ~myns__record();

To specify a set of input files in typemap.dat for wsdl2h to process, use '<':
< infile1.wsdl
< infile2.xsd
< http://www.example.com/example.wsdl

To specify the default output file, use '>', for example:
> example.h

Any other material to be included in the generated header file can be provided
by enclosing the text within brackets [ and ]. Brackets MUST appear at the
start of a new line.

For example, to include a note:
[
// TODO: Don't forget to bind the namespace prefixes!
]
This comment appears as the first line in the generated header file.

INPUT FORMATS

wsdl2h reads from standard input or the files provided at the command line:

wsdl2h [options] [-o outfile.h] [infile1.wsdl infile2.wsdl infile3.xsd ... ]

Valid input file formats are .wsdl and .xsd (schema) files.

Multiple wsdl and schema files can be given, which results in a consolidated
header file with all definitions combined.

OUTPUT FORMAT

The output file is a gSOAP-formatted header file. The header file syntax is
augmented with annotations reflecting WSDL and schema-specific bindings and
validation constraints.

We suggest the use of Doxygen (www.doxygen.org) to produce documented for the
generated header file. However, we STRONGLY recommend user to inspect the
generated header file first for warnings and other annotations (which do not
appear in Doxygen's output) indicating potential problems.

Note that Doxygen's license model does not infinge on your ownership of the
generated gSOAP source code output when you purchased a commercial license.

DOCUMENTATION

See soapdoc2.pdf for documentation.

INSTALLATION

Use './configure' and 'make' in the root directory, as explained in the 
installation instructions.  This builds 'wsdl2h' with all features enabled.

To build 'wsdl2h' when autoconf/automake fail, use:

	make -f MakefileManual

To build 'wsdl2h' with secure features when `./configure' and 'make' fail, use:

	make -f MakefileManual secure

If you don't have OpenSSL installed, you cannot build an SSL-secure version of
wsdl2h. In that case we recommend downloading the WSDL and schema files for
processing with the non-SSL-enabled wsdl2h tool.

A NOTE ON HEAP MEMORY USAGE

Parts of the wsdl2h tool allocate heap memory during its execution to maintain
critical state information during its execution.  No attempt is made to release
this memory before the program terminates.
