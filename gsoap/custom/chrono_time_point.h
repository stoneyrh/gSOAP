/*
	chrono_time_point.h

	Custom serializer for std::chrono::system_clock::time_point as
	xsd:dateTime

	Requires C++11 or higher (compile with -std=c++11).

	#import this file into your gSOAP .h file

	To automate the wsdl2h-mapping of xsd:dateTime to
	std::chrono::system_clock::time_point, add this line to the typemap.dat
	file:

	xsd__dateTime = #import "custom/chrono_time_point.h" | xsd__dateTime

	The typemap.dat file is used by wsdl2h to map types (wsdl2h option -t).

	When using soapcpp2 option -q<name> or -p<name>, you must change
	chrono_time_point.cpp as follows:

		#include "soapH.h"  ->  #include "nameH.h"

	Compile and link your code with custom/chrono_time_point.cpp
