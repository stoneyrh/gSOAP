/*
        qstring.h

        Custom serializer for Qt's QString type as xsd:string.
        
        Requires Qt 4.8 or higher.
        
        NOTE:
        While QStrings can embed '\0' characters, C-strings cannot.
        This serializer treats the first '\0' character in a QString 
        as the end of the string, and truncates the rest.
        
        Use soap context flag SOAP_C_UTFSTRING when initializing 
        your soap struct to enable strings to contain UTF-8 content.
        This option is recommended.

        #import this file into your gSOAP .h file.

        To automate the wsdl2h-mapping of xsd:string to
        QString, add this line to the typemap.dat file:

        xsd__string = #import "custom/qstring.h" | xsd__string 

        When using soapcpp2 option -q<name> or -p<name>, you must change
        qstring.cpp as follows:

                #include "soapH.h"  ->  #include "nameH.h"

        Compile and link your code with custom/qstring.cpp
