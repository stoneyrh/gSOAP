OVERVIEW
--------

This directory contains custom serializers for common data types.

CONTENTS
--------

Custom serializers augment the soapcpp2-generated serialization routines with
serializers for additional C and C++ types.

See the notes in the source files on specific usage.

The following custom serializers are available:

long_double.*       Serializes long double (extended double) type as xsd:decimal
float128.*          Serializes __float128 <quadmath.h> type as xsd:decimal
int128.*            Serializes __int128_t as xsd:integer
struct_tm.*         Serializes struct tm as xsd:dateTime
struct_timeval.*    Serializes struct timeval as xsd:dateTime
duration.*          Serializes LONG64 milliseconds as xsd:duration
struct_tm_date.*    Serializes struct tm as xsd:date
long_time.*         Serializes LONG64 milliseconds as xsd:time
chrono_duration.*   Serializes C++11 std::chrono::nanoseconds as xsd:duration
chrono_time_point.* Serializes C++11 std::chrono::system_clock as xsd:dateTime
qbytearray_base64.* Serializes Qt QByteArray as xsd:base64Binary
qbytearray_hex.*    Serializes Qt QByteArray as xsd:hexBinary
qdate.*             Serializes Qt QDate to xsd:date
qdatetime.*         Serializes Qt QDateTime to xsd:dateTime
qstring.*           Serializes Qt QString to xsd:string (and other XSD)
qtime.*             Serializes Qt QTime to xsd:time

The xsd:dateTime parsers are more permissive to accept alternative ISO8601
formats. To restrict xsd:dateTime formats to the XSD standard, use the
SOAP_XML_STRICT flag.

C VERSUS C++
------------

Only .c files are included here for the custom serializers that work both in C
and in C++.  Copy the .c files that you need to .cpp for compiling and linking
in C++.

THE 2038 PROBLEM
----------------

Because time_t is limited to dates between 1970 and 2038 (on 32 bit systems),
struct tm should be used for wider date ranges.

USAGE
-----

To use a custom serializer, add an import statement to your gSOAP header file.
For example:

    #import "struct_tm.h"

This replaces time_t for xsd__dateTime by struct tm to support a wider date
range. You can then use xsd__dateTime as XML elements and attributes:

    struct ns__example
    {
      @xsd__dateTime start; // attribute
      xsd__dateTime end;    // element
    };

Then run soapcpp2 on this .h file.  Compile and link custom/struct_tm.c with
your project code.

When using soapcpp2 option -q<name>, -q<name>, or -p<name>, you must change
struct_tm.c (and other custom serializer .c/.cpp files that you are using) by
changing #include "soapH.h" as follows:

    #include "soapH.h"  ->  #include "nameH.h"

HOW TO USE TYPEMAP.DAT TO AUTOMATE THE MAPPING TO A CUSTOM TYPE WITH WSDL2H
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

A mapping is specified in typemap.dat as follows:

xsd__dateTime = #import "custom/struct_tm.h"

which maps xsd:dateTime to struct tm when wsdl2h is applied to a WSDL.

xsd__decimal = #import "custom/long_double.h" | long double

This maps xsd:decimal to long double (the column after | specifies usage).

To map xsd:string and other XSD string-like types to a Qt QString:

xsd__string = #import "custom/qstring.h"

IMPLEMENTING YOUR OWN CUSTOM SERIALIZERS
----------------------------------------

To build your own custom serializers: a custom serializer is typically declared
in the imported file as follows

extern typedef Type X;

To implement custom serializers you should implement the following routines:

void soap_default_X(struct soap*, X*);
    sets default values for X
void soap_serialize_X(struct soap*, X const*);
    analyzes X for id-ref serialization (maybe empty)
int soap_out_X(struct soap*, const char *tag, int id, X const*, const char *type);
    emits X in XML as <tag xsi:type=type> (type is optional)
X *soap_in_X(struct soap*, const char *tag, X*, const char *type);
    parses X from XML as <tag xsi:type=type>

To support XML attribute serialization, you should also define:

int soap_s2X(struct soap*, const char *value, X*);
    converts string to X and returns SOAP_OK
const char *soap_X2s(struct soap*, X);
    converts X to string (or NULL when error)
