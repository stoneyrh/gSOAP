The gSOAP 2.8.0 (and 2.8.x updates) software is distributed under:

* The gSOAP Public License 1.3 (which is based on the Mozilla public license
  1.1). Components NOT covered by the gSOAP Public License are:
  - wsdl2h tool and its source code output, 
  - soapcpp2 tool and its source code output,
  - UDDI code,
  - the webserver example code in samples/webserver,
  - and several other example applications in the samples directory.
  For details, see the note below. The gSOAP public license is included in the
  package: gsoap/license.pdf

* GPL (GNU Public License, a common open-source software license) covers all of
  the gSOAP software for non-commercial and educational use only.  The software
  is offered under GPL terms and conditions to allow the software to be used
  with open source GPL projects, educational use, and so on. We do not accept
  third-party GPL contributions to avoid having to fork the code base in GPL
  and non-GPL. GPL is not suitable for commercial product development because
  the software, its modifications, and all other software linked with it must
  be GPL (or compatible) and open sourced to the community.

* Proprietary commercial software development licenses for the standard
  edition. The standard edition is identical to the open source version of
  gSOAP and includes all software components, but without the GPL licensing
  limitations. There is also an enterprise edition that offers the gold
  standard toolset licensing arrangement.

IMPORTANT NOTE: commercial use of the wsdl2h and soapcpp2 code generators,
webserver, UDDI code, and sample applications for commercial development of
products and services requires a commercial-use license. This means that
commercial use of wsdl2h or soapcpp2 to generate code for product development,
or the use of the UDDI source code, or the use of code from the sample Web
service applications requires a commercial software development license.
