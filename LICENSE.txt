Parts of gSOAP are distributed under:

* The gSOAP Public License 1.3 (which is based on the Mozilla public license
  1.1). Components not covered by the gSOAP Public License are wsdl2h and its
  source code output, UDDI, and several sample applications, see note below.
  The gSOAP public license is included in the package: gsoap/license.pdf

* GPL (GNU Public License, a common open-source software license) covers all of
  the gSOAP software for non-commercial and educational use only.

* Proprietary commercial software development licenses for the standard
  edition. The standard edition is identical to the open source version of
  gSOAP and includes all software components, but without the GPL licensing
  limitations. There is also an enterprise edition that offers the gold
  standard toolset.

The software is offered under GPL terms and conditions to allow the software to
be used with open source GPL projects, educational use, and so on. We do not
accept third-party GPL contributions to avoid having to fork the code base in
GPL and non-GPL.

IMPORTANT NOTE: for proprietary use of the wsdl2h code generator, webserver,
UDDI code, and sample applications for commercial development of products and
services requires a commercial-use license. This means that commercial use of
wsdl2h to generate code for product development, or the use of the UDDI source
code, or the use of code from the sample Web service applications requires a
commercial software development license. The reason for this is that the wsdl2h
tool, UDDI and some of the sample applications are not developed at Florida
State University. Please contact me by email if you have any questions on
licensing and software support: engelen AT acm DOT org.

Parts of this program are released under the GPL with the additional exemption
that compiling, linking, and/or using OpenSSL is allowed.

The parts of the code that are distributed under the GPL or Genivia's
commercial license are:

* The wsdl2h WSDL parser source code and the code generated by it.

* The UDDI source code.

* The examples included in the gSOAP distribution package 'samples' directory.
